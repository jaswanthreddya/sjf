A multilevel queue having two queues which will schedule the processes on the basis of preemptive shortest remaining processing time first algorithm followed by scheduling in which
each process will get 2 units of time to execute .And queue 1 has higher priority than queue
2.
As a input user will give
1.Arrival time
2.Burst time
3.Process id
4.And which queue it belongs to either 1 or 2
Algorithm:
Complexity of the program =O(n+n+n+n+n)
 =O(5n)
 =O(n)
